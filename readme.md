This is a facebook-like social network, except it's way damn simpler. This was built with jQuery and Handlebars.js.

### Initializing
  - Make sure you have your templates in a `<scripts type="text/template">` tag with their respective IDs (they're listed on the `_templates` object within the `App`.
  - Make sure the IDs in the `_divs` object within the `App` are correct.
  - `App.init()` will finish the job.
